## WaltonChain CrossChain

### Description
This system is a part of the Waltonchain Cross-chain Project. It realizes endorsement of child chain data to the parent chain. In this system, the ecosystemâ€™s JMN (Judge Master Nodes) and SMN (Super Master Nodes) perform management through voting.
+ The reward transferred by the child chain owner to the corresponding endorsement contract serves as the endorsement reward
+ SMN can endorse child chain data to the parent chain through the SMN System and get the endorsement reward
+ JMN manage JMN, SMN and endorsement contract templates
+ SMN can add child chains and child chain endorsements

### Services 
+ Gwtc node: blockchain node 
+ SMN System: Endorsement operations can be carried out in this system and corresponding rewards can be obtained. 
+ Management System: permission management (including JMN, SMN management), endorsement contract template management, child chain management, endorsement management 
+ Data Verification System: verification of the endorsed data
